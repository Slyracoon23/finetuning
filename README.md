# Fine-Tuning Journey

This project documents my journey and experiments with fine-tuning machine learning models. It includes code, notes, and results from various fine-tuning tasks.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and document the process of fine-tuning pre-trained models on custom datasets. This includes:
- Preparing datasets
- Setting up training environments
- Running fine-tuning experiments
- Evaluating and analyzing results

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd fine-tuning
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies (add your requirements as needed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Add instructions here for running your fine-tuning scripts, e.g.:
```bash
python finetune.py --config config.yaml
```
